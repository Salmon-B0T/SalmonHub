# SalmonHub
This is mainly a boombox gui for Dhrp, pretty useless otherwise.

logger removed and script made opensource cause yes
(the logger in question: https://github.com/Salmon-B0T/Lua-IP-Logger)

I might still add a webhook that sends username when someone exacutes the script for fun, ill also keep that opensource though
